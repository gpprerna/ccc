Our program aims to recreate the operations performed by the Scientific Calculator, Calendar 
and Clock applications found on nearly all our electronic devices using only concepts of C 
programming language. It will allow users to choose which type of widget operation they 
want to perform using the selection control mechanism (switch case) and enter that block and 
take inputs and display results accordingly. We aim to divide our program into multiple 
functions to make it more systematic and we have tried to cover almost all the C concepts 
taught in class. Along with this, we also aim to create a basic GUI for the Calendar part of the 
program, creating a colorful output console and using coordinates to control the output cursor 
while printing and hence aim to enhance our knowledge in that sphere of C programming.
